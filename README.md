## Description
This application is part of my bachelor thesis. It provides a low entry level environment to create datalogging and/or sequencing setups with the Arduino.
The goal was to create a _easy to use_ interface with wich users without coding experience can use the arduino for datalogging and sequencing purposes.

This software is still under development and can therefor be concidered as "_not yet bug free_".
